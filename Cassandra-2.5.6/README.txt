      Cassandra is a generic 3D scientific data viewer written in Java, based
on VTK and providing a native multiplatform support. Including most of the
current filters (clipping, cutting, colour mapping, elevation, etc...),
Cassandra can be used for 3D visualisation and data analysis as well as in
pre/post processing phases. Its modular design, based on plug-ins, allows
numerous possibilities of extension and adaptation to specific purposes.
Cassandra's User Interface (UI) offers several levels of interaction, including
an advanced graphical pipeline manager to facilitate the compositions of
processes and a Jython console for the fine control of low-level components,
like VTK objects.

Cassandra is the result of the internal R&D effort of Artenum Company in
scientific data visualization and analysis. Cassandra illustrates Artenum's
know-how in VTK and high performance Java developments [1][2]. Cassandra is
used for many applications in scientific computing, energy and space
environment analysis. Cassandra is supported by the Artenum Company and an
increasing scientific and industrial community.

Cassandra is a fully open-source project and is freely available free of
charges under the terms of the GPL license. In complement and in order to
provide a professional tool, Artenum proposes a structured set of related
services, including:
    - On-demand development and extension;
    - Closed-source development license;
    - Additional close-source plug-ins for advanced processing;
    - Expertise and study-case analysis for tailored data analysis and
      visualization processes;
    - VTK and data analysis training
